# Stroke Prediction Dashboard

### Stroke Prediction
The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies strokes as the second leading cause of death globally. A stroke happens when a personâ€™s blood supply to their brain is interrupted or reduced, causing brain cells to die within minutes. It prevents the brain tissue from getting the oxygen and nutrients that it needs and is responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.
The objective is to display the charts / plots based on the given dataset about the stroke rate in different countries. The project aims at classifying the stroke based on the input parameters like smoking status, high blood pressure level, cholesterol level and obesity level.
